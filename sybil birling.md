## general analysis

### methods

- Priestley uses Sybil’s dialogue and stage directions to portray her as a symbol of upper-class arrogance and moral failure.
- Contrasts her with the Inspector and other characters to highlight her lack of growth.

### intentions

- To critique the selfishness and hypocrisy of the upper class. 
- To advocate for social responsibility and equality.
- To challenge the audience to reflect on their own attitudes towards class and morality. 

### audience effect

- Creates a strong emotional response against Sybil, aligning the audience with the Inspector’s moral stance.
- Encourages the audience to question societal structures and their own role in perpetuating inequality.
- Reinforces the play’s enduring relevance as a critique of class divisions and moral complacency.
