    - Use of "certainly" to assert her authority and defiance.
    - Reflects her refusal to acknowledge wrongdoing or show remorse.

- **Intentions:**
    - To portray Sybil as stubborn and unwilling to change.
    - To critique the upper class’s resistance to accountability.
    - To contrast her with other characters who begin to show remorse.
        
- **Audience Effect:**
    - Frustrates the audience, as Sybil remains unrepentant.
    - Highlights the difficulty of achieving social change when those in power refuse to listen.
    - Reinforces the play’s call for collective responsibility and moral awakening.
