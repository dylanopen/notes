- [[gcse biology]]
- negative feedback allows for the regulation of body conditions for [[homeostasis]].
- when a [[receptor]] detects that a [[stimulus]] gets too high, the body will respond by the [[effector]] reducing that value.
- when the [[stimulus]] gets too low, the [[effector]] will increase it.
- this creates a **negative feedback loop.**
