- [[an inspector calls]]
- [[sybil birling]]

- **Methods:**
    
    - Use of dismissive tone and condescending language ("a girl of that sort").
    - Assumption about the lower class being motivated solely by money.
    - Irony in her statement, as Eva Smith did refuse money out of pride.
        
- **Intentions:**
    
    - To expose Sybil’s prejudice and lack of understanding of the working class.
    - To highlight the arrogance of the upper class in assuming they know what others want.
    - To critique the dehumanisation of the poor by the wealthy.
        
- **Audience Effect:**
    
    - Provokes anger or frustration at Sybil’s ignorance and superiority complex.
    - Makes the audience sympathise with Eva Smith’s dignity and strength.
    - Reinforces the play’s message about the need for social responsibility.
