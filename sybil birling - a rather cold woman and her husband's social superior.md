- [[an inspector calls]]
- [[sybil birling]]

### Methods
    
- Use of stage directions to establish Sybil’s character before she speaks.
- Adjective "cold" conveys her emotional detachment and lack of empathy.
- Phrase "her husband's social superior" highlights her obsession with class and status.

### Intentions

- To immediately position Sybil as unsympathetic and elitist.
- To critique the upper-class mindset of looking down on others, including her own husband.
- To foreshadow her later refusal to take responsibility for Eva Smith’s death.

### Audience Effect

- Creates an immediate dislike for Sybil, aligning the audience against her.
- Reinforces the play’s critique of class divisions and snobbery.
- Encourages the audience to question the morality of those in positions of power.
