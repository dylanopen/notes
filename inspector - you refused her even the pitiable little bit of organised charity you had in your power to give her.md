- [[an inspector calls]]
- [[sybil birling]]

- **Methods:**
    - Use of accusatory language ("refused," "pitiable") to condemn Sybil’s actions.
    - Contrast between "organised charity" (impersonal) and Eva’s desperate need.
    - Highlights the power imbalance between Sybil and Eva.
        
- **Intentions:**
    - To expose the hypocrisy of charitable organisations that fail to help those in need.
    - To criticise Sybil’s misuse of her power and influence.
    - To emphasise the consequences of her actions on Eva’s life.
        
- **Audience Effect:**
    - Evokes outrage at Sybil’s callousness and the systemic failures of charity.
    - Deepens the audience’s sympathy for Eva Smith.
    - Reinforces the play’s message about the need for genuine compassion and social reform.
