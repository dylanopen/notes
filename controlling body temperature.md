- [[gcse biology]]
- managed by the [[thermoregulatory centre]] in the [[brain]].
	- this contains [[receptor]]s which respond to the change in temperature in the [[blood]] (the [[stimulus]])
	- the [[skin]] also contains temperature [[receptor]]s. it sends info to the [[thermoregulatory centre]].
- if the [[body temperature]] is too high, [[blood vessel]]s dilate (this is called [[vasodilation]]). [[sweat]] is produced from the [[sweat glands]], transferring [[energy]] away from the body.
- if the [[body temperature]] is too low, [[blood vessel]]s constrict (this is called [[vasoconstriction]]). [[sweat|sweating]] stops. [[skeletal muscle]]s contract (leading to [[shivering]]).
