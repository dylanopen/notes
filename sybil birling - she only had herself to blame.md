- [[an inspector calls]]
- [[sybil birling]]

- **Methods:**
    - Blunt, unsympathetic statement reflecting Sybil’s lack of compassion.
    - Use of absolutes ("only") to shift all responsibility onto Eva.
    - Reflects her rigid, judgmental worldview.

- **Intentions:**
    - To criticise the upper class’s tendency to blame the poor for their own suffering.
    - To highlight Sybil’s refusal to accept any responsibility for her actions.
    - To underscore the play’s theme of collective responsibility.

- **Audience Effect:**
    - Shocks the audience with Sybil’s callousness.
    - Increases sympathy for Eva Smith as a victim of systemic injustice.
    - Encourages the audience to reflect on their own attitudes towards blame and responsibility.
