## Potential solutions to increase supply

- [ ] Build 7 new reservoirs
	- [ ] Will cost £800 million
	- [ ] Customers will end up paying more for water
	- [ ] Disruption to local areas and ecosystems
- [ ] Extract more water from natural supplies
	- [ ] Companies must apply for permission
	- [ ] Could damage river ecosystems or groundwater supplies
	- [ ] Groundwater supplies already at maximum capacity during droughts
- [ ] Recycling water (greywater)
	- [ ] May affect river flow as less water goes back into rivers (environmental impacts)

## Potential solutions to reduce demand

- [ ] Install water meters
	- [ ] Can cut water use by 10-15%
	- [ ] Larger families usually pay more
	- [ ] Some people may be against it
- [ ] Cut water use by farmers
