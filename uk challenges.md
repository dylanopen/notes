## What is current UK population?
- 68 million (according to the above graph)

## What is the projected population?
- 80 million by 2060

## Give five impacts the population growth will have on UK ecosystems
- 1 – Increased greenhouse gas emissions leading to pollution (CO2) and climate change
- 2 – Demand for housing causing pressure on greenfield sites/ greenbelt
- 3 – Increased pressure on the local water supply/systems
- 4 – Demand for food increases agribusiness and reduces space for natural habitats
- 5 – Increase urbanisation means there are more permeable surfaces which increases surface runoff and therefore the likelihood of flooding

## Give five ways the UK is addressing the impact on the ecosystems
- 1 – Using renewable energy to reduced greenhouse emissions
- 2 – Sustainable transport schemes
- 3 – using brownfield sites – allowing more greenfield for agriculture
- 4 – Reducing water wastage (fixing leaks), making water efficient homes and other ways of storing water (expanding reservoirs)
- 5 – education on conservation of resources by reducing energy demands in homes and businesses

## Name four types of sustainable transport
- 1 – Park and ride scheme
- 2 – Improvements to public transport (bus lanes, bike schemes etc.)
- 3 – Promotion of hybrid and electric cars
- 4 – Congestion charging (E.g. London)

## Give an overview of the London congestion charge system

- It was introduced in 2003 to charge driver of privately owned transport to entre the centre of London. The aim was to reduce congestion and pollution levels.

## Give facts relating to the impact of the London congestion charge scheme

- According to TfL, traffic levels reduced 10.2% in the first 10 years of the scheme
- Pollutants that affect the air quality and health of Londoners has fallen by 12%.
- But in 2010 there were still 9400 early deaths in London caused by air pollution
- Some suggest the scheme adds congestion to other routes as people try to avoid the charge

## Two speed economy
### Explain
- The uneven economic growth of the UK economy, with the SE and London developing faster than N.
### Effect
- People commute longer distances and more people moving to the south for work. This reduces local workforce and doesn’t encourage investment in those areas.
- House prices rising in London/SE
### Solution
- 1 – HS2 – railway between London and N cities. Construction will provide jobs outside of London.
- 2 – Invest in transport to improve commute within the North.
- 3 – Improve connects to northern airports – encouraging travel and FDI.
- 4 – ‘smart tickets’ for easier access

## Migration
- Migrant=  a person who moves from one area to another to live.
- Emigrant=  a person who leaves their own country to settle in another.
- Immigrant= a person who moves into a country to live there.
- Net migration= When immigration is greater than emigration.

## What are the main patterns for UK migration?
- Both emigration and immigration have increased. Since the 1990’s Immigration has increased more rapidly and overtook the amount of emigration in the UK. This has led to an increase in net migration. 
- What are the main reasons for migration?
- Economic migrants – move for better jobs
- Join family, study or retire
- 2014 4% of UK migrants were refugees

## Views of migration

### Businesses/national government
- Offers more works who help the economy and pay their taxes
- Many bring useful skills
- Improves the multicultural aspects of society
- Younger migrants help balance the UK’s ageing population

### Local governments/individuals
- Puts pressure on local services (health, education and housing).
- Some think economic migrants increase competition for jobs that could go to British workers
- Economic migrants can take advantage of UK’s social benefits system

## List five National Parks
- 1 – New Forest
- 2 – South Downs
- 3 - Dartmoor
- 4 – Brecon Beacons
- 5 – Peak District

## The National Parks have a five point plan for sustainable development
- 1 – ‘conservation apprentices’ to encourage young people to stay and address unemployment
- 2 – renewable energy
- 3 – converting old farm buildings into business premises
- 4 – funding and training for  small businesses 
- 5 – Sustainable transport schemes

## River flood risk in the UK
### Causes
- 1 – increasing population
- 2 – change in land use
- 3 – climate change
### Solutions
- 1 – Prevention – soft and hard engineering
- 2 – Mitigation  (limiting the impacts) – helping people prepare and giving warnings

## Somerset Levels (flood example)
- In SW – prone to flooding due to being low-lying and cross by several rivers
- To reduce risk, the River Tone was diverted to new embanked channel in middle ages
- Recently embankments built on River Parrett and it has been dredged
- 2013/14 7000ha of land & 600 houses flooded
- Locals said defences weren’t good  enough and only protected local towns. They said silt had built up making it shallower. They said EA should have dredged it but EA said they had lack of funds
- Some blamed farmers poor land management leading to run-off eroding soil and clogging up the drainage channels

## Explain storm surges

- Where sea levels are significantly higher than normal due to a combination of high tides, low pressure and strong winds.

## The Thames Barrier example
- The  largest moving flood barrier in the world. Its main purpose is to protect central London from flooding cause by tidal surges.
- December 2013 UK storm surge
- Thames flood barrier was raised
- Media (inc. social media) used to warn people of water contamination from fertilisers and sewage.
- Flood protections and warning systems protected 800,000 homes.

## Addressing coastal flood risk with hard engineering
- Holding the line - Sea walls – prevent erosion and act as a flood barrier. They are expensive and can be damaged overtime so need maintenance. If the wall ever broke with rising sea levels, there would bee a higher volume of water that would flood the land, causing more devastation.

## Addressing coastal flood risk with soft engineering
- Flood defences that work with natural processes to reduce the risk and impact of coastal or river flooding
- Managed retreat – allowing low-lying land to flood up to newly built defend that’s further back on higher land. Flooded areas become salt marshes which act as natural defences and new habitats.

## How will global warming affect UK climate?
- 1 – winter temperatures will increase by 2-4°C
- 2 – summer temperatures will increase 3-5°C
- 3 – winters will become wetter by 15-30% but 15-30% drier in the summer
- 4 -  extreme rainfall will become more frequent and intense

## How will climate change impact the UK?
### Floods
- Changes to precipitation will make flash floods and river flooding morel likely. 
- Rising sea levels will increase risk of coastal flooding
- Flood hazard will increase due to increasing population and pressure on land on floodplains. Government predicts annual cost of flood damage from £2bn to £12bn by 2080
### Water deficits
- Warmer and drier summers increase the risk of drought – less rainfall and more evaporation
- This will lead to water deficit for the growing population, agriculture and industry
- Population in London and SE will be particularly vulnerable
- More summer heatwaves will put pressure on NHS
### Ecosystems
- As well as being under pressure from human activities, many plans and animals will have to adapt to the new climate
- Some may become extinct
- Some species may migrate further north to cooler areas
- Increased competition from native species migrating to the UK
### Food
- Droughts in other parts of the world may reduce food supply = increase in prices

## Responses to climate change
### Local scale
- Individuals/schools/ councils/groups
- Reducing CO2 emissions and resource consumption by:
- Walking or cycling short journeys
- Purchasing locally produced food rather than imported food to reduce ‘food miles’
- Recycling waste materials
- Insulation and double glazing to reduce heat loss so that less heating is used
- Installing solar panels
- Energy efficient water and heating systems
- Education 
- Some councils have given away low-energy lightbulbs or put in place combined heat and power schemes
### National scale – Government
- Campaigns or legislation to encourage people to recycle and reduce resource consumption
- Limit carbon emissions from industry and agriculture
- Investing in the use of renewable energy
- The renewable heat incentive: home owners who use air or ground source heat pumps to provide heat and water get a grant. This also applies if you install thermal hot water heating on your roof.
### International scale
- International agreements – E.g. the Kyoto Protocol , or the 2015 Paris UN climate change conference
- EU carbon trading scheme
