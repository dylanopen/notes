## reflex actions

- reflex actions are [[nervous response]]s which travel via [[neurone]]s to the [[central nervous system]] ([[brain]] and [[spinal cord]]).
- different [[types of neurone]]s are used in each step.
- the [[central nervous system]] then processes and responds to the [[stimulus]]
- reflex actions are automatic and very quick - they do not involve the conscious part of the [[brain]].
- the [[eye]] uses reflex actions to contract and relax the muscles depending on the light levels.
